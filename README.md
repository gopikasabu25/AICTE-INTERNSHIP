ðŸ§  Garbage Classification using Transfer Learning
This project aims to classify garbage into various categories using image data 

ðŸ“… Week 1 Progress
This week focused on preparing the data pipeline and training the model using transfer learning.

âœ… Tasks Completed:
Importing Required Libraries
Loaded essential libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

Dataset Loading
from zip data extract the dataset and loaded

Data Preprocessing
Resized images, normalized pixel values, and explored sample data.

Data Augmentation
Applied transformations  to enrich training data.

Train/Validation Dataset Preparation


Model Building and Training

Built model using MobileNetV2 as the base.

Compiled model with Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy.

Trained model for defined epochs and monitored accuracy/loss.
